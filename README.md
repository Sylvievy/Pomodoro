# Pomodoro
A project to learn JS for React

A basic web-based Pomodoro timer that allows users to start, pause, and reset focused work sessions and short breaks

 Key Learning Goals for This Project
- **MVP:**
    - Master `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` for precise timing.
    - Gain hands-on experience with core DOM manipulation (selecting elements, updating `textContent`).
    - Implement robust conditional logic (`if/else`, `switch`) for timer states and transitions.
    - Practice event handling (`addEventListener` for button clicks).
    - Successfully deploy a basic web application using GitHub Pages.
